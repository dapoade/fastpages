    "    My approach for this problem was to first generate a list of numbers from 1-100 so I can perform the necessary calculation on each number in the list. Once generated, to find the sum of the squares, I squared each number in the list and then added them together. Next, to get the square of the sum, I added all of the numbers in the original list, and then squared the sum. Lastly I took the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum and arrived at 25164150 for my solution.\n",

Once created, I looped through said list to check if they are palindromic in base 2. If the number is palindromic in base 2, I added it to a dictionary with the key being the base 2 number, and the value being the base 10 number. Once the dictionary is completed I added all of the values (base 10 numbers) and got the sum of the numbers that are palindromic in base 10 and base 2. \n",
