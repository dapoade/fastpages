            "content": "Background: . In this blog post I&#39;ve been tasked with analyzing malaria data through three informative visualizations. The data can be found in the following github: . https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-13. . To make my visualizations, I decided to use plotly because of my familiarity and it&#39;s compatibility with Jupyter notebooks. . Malaria Deaths by Country . The first visualization I created color codes the amount of malaria deaths (per 100,000 people) by country from 1990 - 2016 by year. From this graphic we can see that most malaria deaths are in Africa, while a smaller concentration of malaria deaths can be found in Southeast Asia. Additionally as the years go on, Malaria deaths (per 100,000 people) experience significant decrease. The code used to generate the plot can be found below. . malaria_deaths_plot = px.choropleth(malaria_deaths, locations = &#39;Code&#39;, color = &#39;Deaths&#39;, color_continuous_scale= &quot;twilight&quot;, animation_frame = &#39;Year&#39;, height = 750, width = 1000, hover_name = &#39;Code&#39; ) malaria_deaths_plot.update_layout( geo = dict( showcoastlines = False, lataxis_showgrid = True, lonaxis_showgrid = True, projection_type = &#39;natural earth&#39;), hoverlabel = dict( bgcolor = &#39;white&#39;, font_size = 16 ) ) #malaria_deaths_plot.update_layout(margin={&quot;r&quot;:0,&quot;t&quot;:0,&quot;l&quot;:0,&quot;b&quot;:0}) malaria_deaths_plot.show() #HTML(fig.to_html(include_plotlyjs=&#39;cdn&#39;)) #HTML(malaria_deaths_plot.to_html()) . . Malaria Deaths by Age Group . This next graphic displays the malaria death rate by age group by year. From the graphic we can see that children from under 5 are most prone to malaria mortality, while adults aged 70 or older are less susceptible. You can hover over the different years on the graph to get a more descriptive view of the respective death rates. The code used to generate the plot can be found below. . malaria_age = px.line(malaria_deaths_age_mean , x = &#39;year&#39;, y = &#39;deaths&#39;, log_y = True, color = &#39;age_group&#39;, title = &#39;Average Malaria Deaths Per 100,000 People Vs.

Incidents by Country . For my last graphic i decided to make a graphic that highlights Malaria cases per 1,000 people in countries worldwide from 2000 - 2015. A large number of incidents are concentrated in Africa and South East Asia. It is worth noting that many countries decrease their incidence rate over time. . malaria_incidents = px.scatter_geo(malaria_inc, locations=&quot;Code&quot;, size = &#39;Incidents&#39;, animation_frame = &#39;Year&#39;, hover_name = &#39;Entity&#39;, title = &#39;Malaria Incidents Per 100,000 People in Africa Vs.

            "content": "Find the first 10-digit prime in the decimal expansion of 17&#960;. . import math from mpmath import mp . My approach to this problem can be broken down into three parts (or helper functions): . 1. Create a function that expands the decimals of 17pi to a given precision. . 2. Write a function that checks if a specified value is prime. . 3. Write a function that creates a 10 digit sliding window and checks if each window is contains a prime number. . The function below returns 17pi to the specified precision. To generate a large decimal expansion of a number, I decided to use the &#39;mpmath&#39; library. . https://mpmath.org/doc/current/basics.html . The input for the function are the number of digits (num_digits) we want to expand the number to (after the decimal) and the relevant multiplier for this problem. . def digits_after_decimal(num_digits, number, multiplier): &quot;&quot;&quot; Function to generate a specific amount of numbers after the decimal of a multiplier (17) * pi &quot;&quot;&quot; mp.dps = num_digits a = (number * multiplier) expanded = mp.nstr(a, num_digits) expanded = expanded[2:].replace(&#39;.&#39;, &#39;&#39;) return expanded . digits_after_decimal(500, mp.pi, 17) . &#39;407075111026485053864937515751549031351879789376798956574058069232878906865552976676592030815990155696517470725799213000595358362359897939331109938184178996654829745932954858794513958590132233816493395289786586320868584184086019974375313809610432455476025637698825926377723553019627691323424235401653317979112307364998972985855656368097319559161194254174036120192619019329947930863530498183005697360361973596217913063202567163995492854400482787015317265860459366742644982057796323150874949111203135&#39; . . Unit Test . print(&#39;The 6 digit expansion of numbers after the decimal of pi are &#39;14159265 &#39;&#39;) print(&#39;My function generated 6 digit expansion pi is &#39; + str(digits_after_decimal(9, mp.pi, 1))) . The 6 digit expansion of numbers after the decimal of pi are &#39;14159265&#39; My function generated 6 digit expansion pi is 14159265 . The next helper function I needed was to check whether or not a number is prime. To do this, checked to see if there are any factors between 2 and the square root of the number of interest. I looped from 2 to the square root of the number because if a number n is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors a and b: . #### n = a * b | . Because a and b can&#39;t both be greater than the square root of n, since then the product a * b would be greater than sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. So in any factorization of n, at least one of the factors must be smaller than the square root of n, and if we can&#39;t find any factors less than or equal to the square root, n must be a prime. . If the number is divisible by the factor, then I returned False. If the number isn&#39;t divisible by the factor, then I increased the factor by 1 and the loop continues until a either a factor is found or once the factors we are testing become greater than or equal to the square root of our number of interest. . def is_prime(n): if n &lt;= 1: return False max_div = math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) for i in range(2, 1 + max_div): if n % i == 0: return False return True . Unit Test . def test_is_prime(): assert is_prime(131) == True assert is_prime(7) == True assert is_prime(16) == False assert is_prime(169) == False print(&quot;Passed!&quot;) test_is_prime() . Passed! . The last helper function creates a sliding window of 10 digits to traverse the string and determine if the 10 digit sequence/number is prime. . def prime_digits(num_after_dec): &quot;&quot;&quot;A function to find the first 10 digit sequence that&quot;&quot;&quot; for i in range(len(num_after_dec) - 10): digits = num_after_dec[i:i+10] if is_prime(int(digits)): print(f&quot;{digits} is the first 10 digit prime in the decimal expansion&quot;) return digits .

One problems was solved buy less than 500,000 people, the next problem was solved by less than 100,000 people, and the last problem was solved by less than 25,000 people. . Problem 6: Sum square difference . Solved By - 496334 . https://projecteuler.net/problem=6 . The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, $$ 1^{2}+2^{2}+ ldots+10^{2}=385 $$ The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, $$ (1+2+ ldots+10)^{2}=55^{2}=3025 $$ Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025-385=2640$ Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. . Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. . My approach for this problem was to first generate a list of numbers from 1-100 so I can perform the necessary calculation on each number in the list. Once generated, to find the sum of the squares, I squared each number in the list and then added them together. Next, to get the square of the sum, I added all of the numbers in the original list, and then squared the sum. Lastly I took the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum and arrived at 25164150 for my solution. . def sum_square_diff(num): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum for the first hundred natural numbers &quot;&quot;&quot; numbers = list(range(1,num+1)) squared_numbers = [number ** 2 for number in numbers] sum_sq1 = sum(squared_numbers) sum_sq2 = (sum(numbers))**2 diff = abs(sum_sq1 - sum_sq2) return diff . . sum_square_diff(100) . 25164150 . . Problem 36: Double-base Palindromes . Solved By - 89573 . https://projecteuler.net/problem=36 . The decimal number, $585=1001001001_{2}$ (binary), is palindromic in both bases. Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base $2 .$ (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.) . For this problem my first instict was to create a list of of all the natural numbers that are palindromic in base 10. Once created, I looped through said list to check if they are palindromic in base 2. If the number is palindromic in base 2, I added it to a dictionary with the key being the base 2 number, and the value being the base 10 number. Once the dictionary is completed I added all of the values (base 10 numbers) and got the sum of the numbers that are palindromic in base 10 and base 2. . def palindrome_sum(num): &quot;&quot;&quot; Returns a sum of all the natural numbers less than one million that are palindromic in base 10 and base 2&quot;&quot;&quot; palindrome_list = [] # create a list natural numbers in base 10 that are palindrome for i in range(1,num + 1): i = str(i) rev = i[::-1] # reverse the number if i == rev: # if the number is a palindrome, append it to the list palindrome_list.append(i) # convert strings in list to integers palindrome_list = list(map(int, palindrome_list)) match = dict() # loop over palindromic natural numbers to see if binary value is palindromic for a in palindrome_list: binary = bin(a)[2:] # removed the &#39;0b&#39; at the beginning of binary string rev_bin = binary[::-1] if binary == rev_bin: match[binary] = a match return sum(match.values()) . . palindrome_sum(1_000_000) . 872187 . . Problem 112: Bouncy Numbers . Solved By - 24437 . https://projecteuler.net/problem=112 . Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468 .$ . Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, $66420 .$ . We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a &quot;bouncy&quot; number; for example, $155349 .$ . Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches $50 %$ is 538 . . Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to $90 %$. . Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly $99 %$. . To start this problem I determined that I needed a function to determine whether or not a number is bouncy. To check if a number is bouncy I had to make sure that the number was neither increasing nor decreasing. . After creating this function, I&#39;d loop through numbers and if a number was bouncy, I&#39;d add it to a list. To calculate the proportion of bouncy numbers, I&#39;d divide the length of the current list by current number being evaluated. The loop ends when the percent becomes 99%. . def is_bouncy(n): &quot;&quot;&quot; returns whether or not a number is &#39;bouncy&#39; &quot;&quot;&quot; return sorted(str(n)) != list(str(n)) and sorted(str(n)) != list(str(n))[::-1] def bouncy_99(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Finds the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%.&quot;&quot;&quot; percent = 0 i = 0 bouncy_list = [] while percent &lt; .99 : i += 1 if is_bouncy(i): bouncy_list.append(i) percent = len(bouncy_list) / i return i, percent . . bouncy_99() .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
